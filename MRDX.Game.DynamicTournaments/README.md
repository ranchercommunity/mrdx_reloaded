## Dynamic Tournament Progression for MR2DX

* Tournament Monsters (the opponents you fight against) are both randomly generated, and grow alongside you as months pass.
* Tournament Monsters will rank up, learn techniques, and become stronger alongside you!
* Tournament Monster species are, by default, generally locked to similar breeds you have available.
* The mod includes a few optional gameplay tweaks to promote the use and engagement with tournaments.

### Latest Update
* v0.3.0
* Code Refactoring - Code is easier to parse and work on, supporting future development!
* Improved Technique Logic - Monsters choose techniques a little bit more intelligently.
* Base Stat Incorporation - Additional configuration options to lock monsters to realistic move speeds, guts rates, and growth patterns.
* FIMBA Progression - Participate in those FIMBA Tournaments! You may see familiar faces rise though the ranks too!
* Spread Tournament Pools - Special tournaments (Phoenix, Hero, Heel, etc.) will now use the same pool of monsters from regular tournaments!
* * Restrictions still apply to those tournaments. This will result in high rank base tournaments having monsters you may not have unlocked yet.

### Important Information
Autosaves are still in testing. If you regularly use AutoSaves, ensure the correct configuration option is selected!
You may keep the feature enabled, but loading an autosave will wipe your progress unless the Experimental Autosave Support is enabled!

## Dynamic Tournament Progression for MR2DX

* Tournament Monsters (the opponents you fight against) are both randomly generated, and grow alongside you as months pass.
* Tournament Monsters will rank up, learn techniques, and become stronger alongside you!
* Tournament Monster species are, by default, generally locked to similar breeds you have available.
* The mod includes a few optional gameplay tweaks to promote the use and engagement with tournaments.

### Latest Update
* v0.3.0
* Code Refactoring - Code is easier to parse and work on, supporting future development!
* Improved Technique Logic - Monsters choose techniques a little bit more intelligently.
* Base Stat Incorporation - Additional configuration options to lock monsters to realistic move speeds, guts rates, and growth patterns.
* FIMBA Progression - Participate in those FIMBA Tournaments! You may see familiar faces rise though the ranks too!
* Spread Tournament Pools - Special tournaments (Phoenix, Hero, Heel, etc.) will now use the same pool of monsters from regular tournaments!
* Autosave Settings have been defaulted to enabled.
* * Restrictions still apply to those tournaments. This will result in high rank base tournaments having monsters you may not have unlocked yet.

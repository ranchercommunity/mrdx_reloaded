# Dynamic Tournament Progression for MR2DX - v0.3.5

* Tournament Monsters (the opponents you fight against) are both randomly generated, and grow alongside you as months pass.
* Tournament Monsters will rank up, learn techniques, and become stronger alongside you!
* Tournament Monster species are, by default, generally locked to similar breeds you have available.
* The mod includes a few optional gameplay tweaks to promote the use and engagement with tournaments.





### Latest Updates

##### v0.3.5

* Emergency hotfix to resolve an issue with the monster name pool causing soft-locks at week end.



##### v0.3.4

* Added an additional 50 new names to the pool!
* Monsters will *actually* no longer share names!
* Fixed an issue where the Dragon Tusk and Double-Edge fights were providing the opposite opponent.
* Slightly increased the chance of a monster prioritizing defense over speed for its primary defensive stat.



##### v0.3.3

* Added over 100 new names to the pool!
* Monsters will no longer share names.
* Some names are reserved for certain breeds. Existing monsters can be 'reborn' and seen again for later monsters!



##### v0.3.2

* Mandatory to accommodate MRDX Base Mod update.



##### v0.3.1

* Fix for minor incompatibility with the More Monsters Mod.



##### v0.3.0

* Code Refactoring - Code is easier to parse and work on, supporting future development!
* Improved Technique Logic - Monsters choose techniques a little bit more intelligently.
* Base Stat Incorporation - Additional configuration options to lock monsters to realistic move speeds, guts rates, and growth patterns.
* FIMBA Progression - Participate in those FIMBA Tournaments! You may see familiar faces rise though the ranks too!
* Spread Tournament Pools - Special tournaments (Phoenix, Hero, Heel, etc.) will now use the same pool of monsters from regular tournaments!

        Note: Restrictions still apply to those tournaments. This will result in high rank base tournaments having monsters you may not have unlocked yet.

* Autosave Settings have been defaulted to enabled.

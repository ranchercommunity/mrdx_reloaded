# More Monsters - Version 0.1.0

## Features

* Adds additional species (50+!) combinations to the game and support for being able to acquire them.
* Monsters have size variations, making every monster unique!
* Monsters can have multiple appearances for the same species.
* Monsters can be generated from the shrine or combined from existing monsters.



**Note:** To prevent potential issues, save files using the More Monsters mod are not compatible for Vs uploads.



## Usage Guide

New monsters have replaced the existing monster generated for CD Slots starting with the letter of the main species for the Artist Name.

To generate new monsters, follow the below steps.

1. Access the Shrine
2. Enter 'More Monsters' for the Title of the song.
3. Choose any of the available species combinations!
4. Optionally, to reduce the page count, also enter the main breed name for the Artist if you know which monster you want to create!



For example, to generate Durandal the new Centaur/Henger monster, enter 'More Monsters' for the Title and 'C' for the Arist, then select 'Centaur / Henger' from the Artist list.



***Note*:** You must have access to the main breed to generate new creatures utilizing those breeds.



Alternatively to obtain the new species, combine monsters with the main/subs of the new species you want.



Monster size variations are random from the shrine, and partially inherited from parents when combining.

# More Monsters - Version 0.2.0

## Features

* Adds additional species (50+!) combinations to the game and support for being able to acquire them.
* Monsters have size variations, making every monster unique!
* Monsters can have multiple appearances for the same species.
* Monsters can be generated from the shrine or combined from existing monsters.
* Monsters are supported for VS Play!



##### Updating to 0.2.0 from a previous version:

The update from 0.1.2 to 0.2.0 has involved considerable changes to the way monster information is stored to allow for VS Mode uploads.

With this in mind, all monsters generated with the mod and in the freezer will immediately be altered, and any monsters currently being

used will be affected when frozen. Unfortunately, there was no way to handle all cases (existing Non-MM Saves, MM-Saves, a mixture of both)

and the decision was made to break existing MM-Saves. It is recommended that all existing monsters be deleted and the save continued.

This update should not cause any issues with the save itself, only the monsters generated prior to the save.



## Usage Guide

New monsters have replaced the existing monster generated for CD Slots starting with the letter of the main species for the Artist Name.

To generate new monsters, follow the below steps.

1. Access the Shrine
2. Enter 'More Monsters' for the Title of the song.
3. Choose any of the available species combinations!
4. Optionally, to reduce the page count, also enter the main breed name for the Artist if you know which monster you want to create!



For example, to generate Durandal the new Centaur/Henger monster, enter 'More Monsters' for the Title and 'C' for the Arist, then select 'Centaur / Henger' from the Artist list.



Alternatively to obtain the new species, combine monsters with the main/subs of the new species you want.



Monster size variations are random from the shrine, and partially inherited from parents when combining.

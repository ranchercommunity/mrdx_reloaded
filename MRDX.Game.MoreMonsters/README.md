# More Monsters - Version 0.1.0

## Features

Adds additional species combinations to the game and support for being able to acquire them.

Monsters have size variations, making every monster unique!

Monsters can have multiple appearances for the same species.



Monsters can be generated from the shrine or combined from existing monsters.



**Note:** To prevent potential issues, save files using the More Monsters mod are not compatible for Vs uploads.



## Usage Guide

New monsters have replaced the existing monster generated for CD Slots starting with 'Z' for the Artist Name.

To generate new monsters, follow the below steps.

1. Access the Shrine
2. Enter in 'Z' for the Artist Name
3. Choose any of the first X options, where X is the number of unique species in the mod.



*Note*: You must have access to the main breed to generate new creatures utilizing those breeds.



For version 0.1.0, there are 40 new monster species! Any option between pages 1 and 8 will generate a new monster.



Alternatively, combine monsters with the main/subs of the new species you want to access the monster.



Monster size variations are random from the shrine, and inherited from parents when combining.

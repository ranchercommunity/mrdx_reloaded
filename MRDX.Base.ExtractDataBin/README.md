## Library to extract data.bin

Monster Rancher 2 uses a zipped file called data.bin that stores most of the game files.
But the game is programmed to load these files first from disk if it can find them, so
by extracting the data.bin file. we can use file redirector mods more easily.

This is intended really only for developers to bother with.

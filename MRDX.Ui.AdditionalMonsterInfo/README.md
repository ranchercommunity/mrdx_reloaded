#### Additional Information - Locations and Descriptions

##### On The Ranch

* **SFLi -** An abbreviated term for Stress, Fatigue, and Lifespan Index (Penalty)



0 0 0 represents a monster with zero fatigue, zero stress, and zero penalty to its life when advancing the week.

20 40 -1 represents a monster with 20 stress, 40 fatigue, and if nothing changes, the monster will lose an additional week of life when advancing to the next week.



Note: The mod does not account for any activities performed that week. Resting with a -1 penalty may reduce stress and fatigue below the threshold, while performing

drills with 20 stress and 28 fatigue will result in a penalty being applied.
